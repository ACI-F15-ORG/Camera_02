### Goals:

1. Camera
2. Installation Drawings

#### 1. Camera
Use a still camera, video camera, kinect, leap motion or other image capture device in an interactive/reactive project. This project is required to be at least responsive to a participant.

#### 2. Installation Drawings 
Think about how the ideal setup of your work might be installed/setup in a space. Make a quick diagram (side and/or top perspective) with dimensions and where screens, speakers, computer, camera, misc equipment might be placed.

#### 4. Clone, Add, Commit, Push
First is to make your own repository of files and sync it to github. Then, Clone this assignment directory to your computer. From within the folder of the clone, use the terminal. Replace _remote-url_ with something like _https://github.com/shawnlawson/shawnmodule.git_ and _folder-name_ with _shawn_

```bash
git submodule add remote-url folder-name
```

Then you'll need to add and commit:

```bash
git commit -a -m 'adding submodule'
```

Lastly, you'll need to push this back to the remote:

```bash
git push
```

__Warning__ you can only push if you're a member of our organization. And, do not delete anything from the repository before pushing.
