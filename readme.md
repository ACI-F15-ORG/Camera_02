#### 1. Camera
Use a still camera, video camera, kinect, leap motion or other image capture device in an interactive/reactive project. This project is required to be at least responsive to a participant.

#### 2. Installation Drawings 
Think about how the ideal setup of your work might be installed/setup in a space. Make a quick diagram (side and/or top perspective) with dimensions and where screens, speakers, computer, camera, misc equipment might be placed. 

#### 3. Read
